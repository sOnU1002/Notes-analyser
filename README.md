## üìù Methodologies Used  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Named Entity Recognition (NER)**  
- Uses **SciSpaCy** for extracting medical entities from text.  
- **BioBERT** enhances NER by detecting **diseases, symptoms, and treatments** with higher accuracy.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Text Summarization**  
- Uses the **Facebook BART Large Model** for generating concise summaries of medical text.  
- Ensures key medical details are retained while reducing text length.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Sentiment & Intent Analysis**  
- Utilizes a **DistilBERT-based sentiment classifier** to analyze patient responses.  
- Identifies whether the sentiment is **Anxious or Reassured** and categorizes patient intent (e.g., Reporting symptoms, Seeking reassurance).  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ SOAP Note Generation**  
- Converts extracted medical data into the **SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) format** for structured medical documentation.
